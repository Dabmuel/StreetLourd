# StreetLourd

Simple project I made to register my runs on Forza Horizon 5, and then generate a global ranking to know which car is better.
Since I don't think that anyone else will ever use it, I won't bother explaining or commenting the code.

Made in .NET Core C# WPF with VS2019 using an MVC architecture.
